Steps:
- collect images (same extension for all). Naming convention is "0.png", "1.png", ..., "nunmber.png"
- optionnally add a "collection.png"
- Each image shall have its json file. In practice we'd use a script to generate those json. Here we wrote it manually.
- Then use `sugar launch` to create the nft collection configuration file
